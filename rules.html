<h2>Mass Disconnections</h2>
        <p><strong><em>Within Opening 25% of racing laps</em></strong><br />- In the event of a mass disconnection or problems with the lobby where 20% or greater drivers being disconnected within the opening 5 laps, the race will be abandoned and the event restarted immediately, In the event of an immediate re-race, the - - weather will match the original race conditions but we will set the grid up manually as per the original grid.</p>
        <p><br /><em><strong>After 25% of racing laps have been completed</strong></em><br />- Where 20% or greater drivers are affected, the race will be stopped and deemed as a red flag scenario and restarted with a standing start with the order determined by the positions immediately prior to the first disconnection event happening<br />- If the disconnection event occurs during the period of a safety car or virtual safety car, then the order will be taken from immediately prior to the safety car coming out<br />- Any cars that have DNF&rsquo;d or been disqualified will not be allowed to restart the race<br />- Where the completed laps total at the point of red flag is between 25% completed laps and 50% race distance then a 35% distance race will be used for restart purposes<br />- Where the completed laps total at the point of red flag is between 50% and 75% race distance then a 25% distance race will be used for restart purposes<br />- If we have completed 75% or more of race distance, half points will be awarded as per race positions at that point and no re-run of the race will be required.<br />- if we have completed 90% or more of race distance, full points will be awarded as per race positions at that point and no re-run of the race will be required.<br />- If 20% of drivers that are still in the race (ie. not DNF or DSQ) are unable to rejoin the new lobby then the race will be abandoned and a will be rescheduled at the earliest opportunity<br />- If Crossplay is found to be the cause of the connection issues then a restart without crossplay will be chosen with the the PS5/4 being the priority console, anyone on an alternative console will be shunned and embarrased<br /> <br />
        <h2>Point Scoring</h2><br />The league will follow the real life points scoring system awarding 25-18-15-12-10-8-6-4-2-1 points to the top 10 drivers.<br />as of f1 2025 no points are awarded for whoever sets the fastest lap<br />At the end of the season, if 2 drivers are tied then the driver with the most wins will be awarded the higher spot.
