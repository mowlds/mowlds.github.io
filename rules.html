            <h2 style="font-style: normal; text-align: center;">SRL RULES AND DRIVING REGULATIONS</h2>
            <br />

<h2>Race Day Schedule</h2>

<h3>Confirmation</h3>
<ul>
  <li style="display: block;">In the event of grids potentially exceeding 20 the deadline for confirmation of your participation is 23.59 on the Saturday or Tuesday before race day. Regardless, participation can be confirmed either on the thread on the SI forums or within the discord with regular SRL racers given priority, confirmation is strongly encouraged for fairness for all potential racers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Raceday Schedule</h3>
<ul>
  <li style="display: block;">On a raceday within the calendar, a lobby will be created for anybody to join around 9pm where 3 lap practice races with qualifying will begin.</li>
  <li style="display: block;">At no earlier than 9.45pm and pending waiting on any confirmed latecomers, a full event will be set up.</li>
  <li style="display: block;">Drivers are expected to be in the correctly assigned car prior to the event launching.</li>
</ul>


            <h2>Driving Regulations</h2>

            <h3>General Conduct</h3>
            <ul>
                <li style="display:block;"> <strong>Fair Play</strong>: Intentional crashing, blocking, or race manipulation (e.g. causing safety cars) is grounds for severe disciplinary action.</li>
                <li style="display:block;"> <strong>Clean Racing</strong>: Racing incidents will happen, but reckless driving will be penalised.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Race Etiquette</h3>
            <ul>
                <li style="display:block;"><strong>Track Limits</strong>: The in-game track limits system is adhered to. The stewards will not overturn in game penalties awarded by the game.</li>
                <li style="display:block;"><strong>Rejoining Safely</strong>: After leaving the track, you must rejoin only when it’s safe to do so. Dangerous rejoins may lead to penalties.</li>
                <li style="display:block;">Reset to track should only be used in circumstances where you are stuck. Any time loss or damage caused to other drivers through the use of reset to track will be punished via the penalty points system.</li>
                <li style="display:block;"><strong>Blue Flags</strong>: Lapped cars must yield to faster cars without impeding them. The in-game blue flag system is adhered to, however the stewards are able to hand out additional penalties if the lapped car causes excessive time loss or damage when being lapped.</li>
                <li style="display:block;"><strong>Yellow Flags</strong>: Drivers must slow appropriately and not overtake under yellow flag conditions unless the car ahead is off-track or ghosted.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Qualifying Rules</h3>
            <ul>
                <li style="display:block;"><strong>Impedance</strong>: Blocking another driver on a flying lap is strictly prohibited.</li>
                <li style="display:block;"><strong>Out/In Laps</strong>: Drivers on out-laps or in-laps must yield to those on flying laps.</li>
                <li style="display:block;"><strong>Retiring</strong>: If retiring in qualifying, do so safely off the racing line and outside of blind corners.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Overtaking and Defending</h3>
            <ul>
                <li style="display:block;"><strong>Racing Room</strong>: Leave space when racing other drivers. Forcing another driver off the track is not allowed.</li>
                <li style="display:block;"><strong>Defensive Moves</strong>: Only one defensive move per straight is permitted. No weaving.</li>
                <li style="display:block;"><strong>Dive Bombs</strong>: Late lunges that result in contact or a loss of control will be penalised unless clean and controlled.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Starts and Safety Cars</h3>
            <ul>
                <li style="display:block;"><strong>Race Starts</strong>: No intentional false starts.</li>
                <li style="display:block;"><strong>Safety Car</strong>:</li>
                <li style="display:block;">No overtaking unless instructed.</li>
                <li style="display:block;">Maintain a consistent gap and avoid erratic braking.</li>
                <li style="display:block;">Drivers may not cause unnecessary safety cars for strategic gain.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Penalties and Stewarding</h3>
            <ul>
                <li style="display:block;"><strong>Incident Reports</strong>: Drivers may submit reports with video evidence within 24 hours of the race.</li>
                <li style="display:block;"><strong>Stewards Panel</strong>: All incidents will be reviewed by 3 impartial stewards, selected at random post race. Decisions are final.</li>
                <li style="display:block;"><strong>Penalty Types</strong>:</li>
                <li style="display:block;">Time penalties</li>
                <li style="display:block;">Qualifying bans</li>
                <li style="display:block;">Race bans or suspensions</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Connection and Technical Issues</h3>
            <ul>
                <li style="display:block;"><strong>Lagging/Glitching Cars</strong>: If your connection is unstable, you may be asked to leave and fix it before returning.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Car Setup and Assists</h3>
            <ul>
                <li style="display:block;"><strong>Custom Setups</strong>: Allowed.</li>
                <li style="display:block;"><strong>Parc Fermé</strong>: Setup changes must follow in-game Parc Fermé regulations.</li>
            </ul>

            <br />
           <h2>Mass Disconnections</h2>
<ul>
  <li style="display: block;"><strong><em>Within Opening 25% of racing laps</em></strong><br>
    - In the event of a mass disconnection or problems with the lobby where 20% or greater drivers being disconnected within the opening 5 laps, the race will be abandoned and the event restarted immediately.</li>
  <li style="display: block;">
    In the event of an immediate re-race, the weather will match the original race conditions but we will set the grid up manually as per the original grid.
  </li>
  <li style="display: block;"><em><strong>After 25% of racing laps have been completed</strong></em><br>
    - Where 20% or greater drivers are affected, the race will be stopped and deemed as a red flag scenario and restarted with a standing start with the order determined by the positions immediately prior to the first disconnection event happening.</li>
  <li style="display: block;">
    - If the disconnection event occurs during the period of a safety car or virtual safety car, then the order will be taken from immediately prior to the safety car coming out.
  </li>
  <li style="display: block;">
    - Any cars that have DNF’d or been disqualified will not be allowed to restart the race.
  </li>
  <li style="display: block;">
    - Where the completed laps total at the point of red flag is between 25% completed laps and 50% race distance then a 35% distance race will be used for restart purposes.
  </li>
  <li style="display: block;">
    - Where the completed laps total at the point of red flag is between 50% and 75% race distance then a 25% distance race will be used for restart purposes.
  </li>
  <li style="display: block;">
    - If we have completed 75% or more of race distance, half points will be awarded as per race positions at that point and no re-run of the race will be required.
  </li>
  <li style="display: block;">
    - If we have completed 90% or more of race distance, full points will be awarded as per race positions at that point and no re-run of the race will be required.
  </li>
  <li style="display: block;">
    - If 20% of drivers that are still in the race (ie. not DNF or DSQ) are unable to rejoin the new lobby then the race will be abandoned and a will be rescheduled at the earliest opportunity.
  </li>
  <li style="display: block;">
    - If Crossplay is found to be the cause of the connection issues then a restart without crossplay will be chosen with the PS5/4 being the priority console, anyone on an alternative console will be shunned and embarrassed.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Point Scoring</h2>
<ul>
  <li style="display: block;">The league will follow the real life points scoring system awarding 25-18-15-12-10-8-6-4-2-1 points to the top 10 drivers.</li>
  <li style="display: block;">As of F1 2025 no points are awarded for whoever sets the fastest lap.</li>
  <li style="display: block;">At the end of the season, if 2 drivers are tied then the driver with the most wins will be awarded the higher spot.</li>
  <li style="display: block;">Should the 2 drivers also be tied on this then the driver with the most poles will be awarded the higher spot.</li>
  <li style="display: block;">Should we still have a tie here then the driver with the most fastest laps will be awarded the higher spot.</li>
</ul>
