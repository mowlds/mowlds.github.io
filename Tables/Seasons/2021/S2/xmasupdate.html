          <h3>"Are we racing now? We are aren't we?" - SRL 2021 S2 Season Review (Part 1)</h3><br /><strong>Round 1 &ndash; Mexico</strong><br />An atypical starting location for the season gave us a predictable result with Tony laying down a marker by winning from pole and claiming the fastest lap to boot. Maxey picked up a treble of his own as the first to retire in both qualifying and the race and also the first to have a mid-race headsgone. Beckford joined him at the back of the grid following his own qualy DNF but had a much more positive race claiming the Driver of the Day award from both the game and the fans en route to 6th place. Ry did the opposite with a poor strategy decision and a couple of bits of contact meaning he couldn&rsquo;t back up his excellent 5th place in qualifying, eventually missing out on points entirely. CJ and Blarg joined Tony on the podium ahead of Jehrome, Hom and Chuggzi while Hags&rsquo; pace was once again undermined by unfortunate contact and ropey physics and Nick&rsquo;s first attempt at enjoying the game ended in an intentional DNF in the wall. Elsewhere Mav and Rob&rsquo;s 5 stop strategies produced mixed results with the latter finishing 8th ahead of Wiggins and DP, and IMM&rsquo;s late fastest lap attempt proved unsuccessful.</p>

Honestly what the **** was that? Jesus Christ.

          <p><strong>Round 2 &ndash; San Marino</strong><br />It was back to the future for the SRL on its first visit to the historic and beloved Imola track as multiple former champion Haguey stood atop the podium for the first time in 27 races. Blarg and CJ swapped podium positions from Mexico while a strategic error cost Tony the chance to take a second consecutive win from pole, ending up in 4th. Hom, Jehrome and Chuggzi achieved a second points finish in two races while Frankie, Mav and Port all got off the mark for the season, the latter with an excellent drive to 10th&nbsp;having been a lap down after only 6 laps. Nick, Stefarno and Ry all finished but remain yet to get off the mark as does Owl who made his season debut. DP became the second driver to fail to pick up points from the third row&nbsp;ending up retired after an early spin, as did Hamilton and Monty who had a coming together that Chuggzi had a good view of.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Round 3 &ndash; Italy</strong><br />Hom put in a very strong early claim for drive of the season by scything through the pack from 16th to take a sensational victory, while championship leader Tony went the other way after getting involved in midfield nonsense after his pit stop for an eventual 10th place. Nick got off the mark for the season in 2nd after securing his first pole in 58 races while new championship leader CJ got his 3rd consecutive podium just ahead of Blarg.&nbsp;Wiggins lagged his way to 5th while&nbsp;Sunny and Monty joined Nick in getting off the mark with 6th and 9th places respectively, Chuggzi continued his 100% scoring record in 7th and Rob recovered from being off the back after T1 to claim his customary 8th.&nbsp;For the third consecutive race a surprise row 3 qualifier came away empty handed, as in Mexico this was to be Ry's fate after contact with Chuggzi and pit stop shenanigans with lagging teammate Wiggins. There were notable outings for the two least experienced racers on the grid as&nbsp;RFM spent much of the race in the points before a wobble caused a 5 car incident with DP, Chuggzi, Hamilton and Rob; FG also ran in the points before filtering back to an eventual 14th. Haguey followed up his Imola glory with an early DNF, as did Jehrome after repeated Codemasters induced shambles and a headsgone.&nbsp;More than anyone though it was Hamilton who had an event of shame, ruining his final qualy run by getting a next lap invalidation on turn 1, selecting the wrong tyres to start on, spinning Rob at T1, making the wrong strategy call under the first safety car, clipping the back of Blarg and ending Maxey's race by spinning into his path, losing a wing in the 5 car pileup and then another one on the back of DP - but there was a silver lining for him with the fastest lap.</p>

          <p>Ry&rsquo;s quotation corner:<br />"I never had Mav down as a 16 year old girl" - Maxey responds with surprise upon learning where his teammate was for the evening<br />"DP do you wanna tap the brakes so I can catch on to you in the next 5 seconds?" &ndash; Jehrome; "No" - DP, as Jehrome thinks he gets a drive through for not being close enough to DP but actually gets it for being above the delta<br />"Oh my God this game, what does the game want me to do? What am I meant to do? It's literally, nah what's the point, there's no point it's given me another drive through" - Jehrome remains over the delta to earn another drive through and promptly retires, leaves the party and ends his stream<br />"Ooooh headsgone oooh I got a drive through oooh" - Wiggins is sympathetic to Jehrome's plight as Ry, ever the ear for accents, thinks this high pitched impression is actually the now departed Jehrome<br />"It's like a theme park ride when you're seeing all the bloody elephants and stuff in the safari world" - Ry mixes his metaphors to describe life in the post safety car train<br />"Hom into the lead" &ndash; Stig; "Who's leading?" - Ry within two seconds of Stig telling us Hom had taken the lead<br />"No Chuggzi **** me, Chuggzi you ****ing pile of **** ****, Jesus ****ing Christ, Chuggzi you dickhead" - Ry connects with Chuggzi and later threatens to take a **** on his desk at work</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Round 4 &ndash; Russia</strong><br />After the madness of Monza it was time for something of a comedown with a relative snoozefest at Sochi. For the first time in 34 races all 20 starters made the finish as Tony returned to form with a dominant win from pole, however with CJ claiming yet another podium the championship lead stays away from Scotland for at least one more race. Hamilton recovered from his Italian shambles to join his Red Bull teammate on the podium and eat into the Aston Martin lead of the teams' championship with Hom absent and Blarg in a lowly (for him) 6th place. It was also a case of bouncing back from adversity for Jehrome and Hags with the former keeping his head to finish 4th and the latter storming through from last to 5th and the fastest lap after an early qualifying retirement. Front row starter Nick on the other hand had one of his trademark pieces of misfortune as a combination of pit exit and VSC ending gave him a drive through penalty and eventual 7th place, while Frankie was also on the end of Codemasters shambles being put on the wrong tyres, but still brought the car home in 10th. The other points scorers were the ever-consistent Chuggzi in 8th and Sunny in 9th, backing up his excellent first points of the season last time out. At the other end of the field the lack of safety cars caused shambles for those who'd underfuelled with 3 cars running dry in the closing stages - DP beat Owl to the line for 15th in an epic finale before dropping back behind both Owl and RFM on penalties, while Stefarno was able to do his whole race on hards and not be disqualified thanks to ending a lap down.</p>

          <p>The Beef Register:<br />Nick v Codemasters<br />Frankie v his pit crew</p>
          <p>Ry&rsquo;s quotation corner:<br />"Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh Chuggzi" - Jehrome launches a long range move on a slightly weaving Chuggzi down the main straight<br />"Why do I play this game?" - Nick becomes justifiably existential after his drive through<br />"You disgust me Mav" - Jehrome is unimpressed with Chuggzi getting DRS on Mav<br />"Oh please don't let me come out behind Stefarno, not again" - Mav endures the pain felt by everyone in the league at one time or another; "Don't worry, I'm pitting in about 9 laps or so" - Stefarno lies to Mav</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Round 5 &ndash; Japan</strong><br />CJ underlined his title credentials at the first rain-impacted race of the season, edging ahead of Tony to take victory. Back-to-back pole-sitter (by 3 thousandths) Nick and IMM's decisions to stick out the last couple of laps on dry tyres enraged DP and backfired with them falling from 1st and 5th to 11th and 13th respectively, while Sunny's decision to start on hards and take them all the way to the rain proved a masterstroke as he finished 5th from 19th on the grid. There were also strong drives from non-top 10 starting positions from Hom and Rob who rose from 12th and 11th to 3rd and 6th. A 'bogus' time penalty and staying out an extra lap as the weather changed dropped Hamilton to 8th behind Blarg who had a coming together with DP but did collect his first fastest lap of the season, while Wiggins and Port came home for 9th and 10th. Chuggzi's point scoring streak ended in spectacular fashion with an early qualy DNF and a lap 1 DNF in the race thoroughly meriting his request to delay the start of the event, and Jehrome lost good points after one of his customary tech issues.</p>

          <p><strong>Round 6 &ndash; Bahrain</strong><br />The season's first trip to the Middle East brought the most carnage filled race so far, beginning with RFM and Jehrome's Turn 1 torpedo impressions which between them cost Nick his front right wheel and directly or indirectly forced 8 cars into the pits, four of them with time penalties. After the dust/sand had settled from this and the 4 safety car restarts of varying levels of shambles we were left with a 3 way fight for the win; Tony, Hags and CJ. The latter two combined to spin out the defending champion and an optimistic last lap move from Hags also cost him a spin and ensured CJ got his second consecutive win to extend his championship lead to 26 points as the two old foes limped home in 6th and 5th respectively. The other two podium slots were filled by Jehrome and Hom coming through from 13th (after a Hamilton induced qualifying penalty) and 10th, while Stefarno belatedly got off the mark for the season with an exceptional 1 stop drive from 19th to 4th and Ry did the same coming home in 9th, a couple of seconds ahead of Rob. The other points scorers were Chuggzi who having taken a sensational 3rd on the grid was sent to 18th in the T1 chaos and recovered well to 7th, and the typically understated Frankie in 8th. Further back the characteristically attritional race claimed Blarg, Port, Hamilton, the ever-unlucky Maxey and Sunny, the latest driver to suffer an equipment malfunction having been driving up in 5th at the time his controller decided to turn off. DP was the victim of multiple shambles and 10 seconds worth of T1 penalties but claimed a morale boosting fastest lap at the end.</p>

Mav hurry the **** up! Mav where are you!" - Ry illegally overtakes Mav<br />"Sunny man Jesus Christ" - DP (ultrasonic). The restart is indeed bad, for the full effect please listen to the previous 4 comments at 0.25x speed<br />"Are we racing now? We are aren't we?" - Ry correctly surmises that the safety car has gone in<br />"He's gone full Grosjean" - Hom as Sun's controller packs up and he swerves all over the place and eventually into the wall</p>
          <p><strong>Round 7 &ndash; France</strong><br />The customary tedium of Paul Ricard was the chance for the two drivers who actually enjoy the track to showcase their skills as Hamilton took a stunning maiden pole and Nick got his first win of the season despite at no point leading the race on track. Hamilton's race didn't go quite to plan with a late spin seeing him finish in 7th but he still had a better time of it than the returning Semi and perpetually unfortunate Maxey who didn't make the end of lap 1 after spinning into the barrier. Back at the front Blarg and Tony rounded out the podium with CJ missing out for the first time this season but doing an excellent job of damage limitation ending up 4th at a track he openly (and rightly) hates. Hom continued his recent strong form in 5th, with Jehrome making amends for his Bahrain shambles in 6th while Mav's exemplary tyre wear gave him his first experience of leading a race, eventually rolling home in 8th ahead of Rob and DP who rounded out the points. Conspicuous by their absence from the points where the three drivers who started 5th, 6th and 7th as Hags jumped the start causing Ry and Chuggzi to go with him. That, coupled with an opening lap smash that required a pit stop was the end of Chuggzi's quest for points while Ry also couldn't get much going as the dynamic duo ended in 13th and 12 respectively; Hags however had a strong run back into the points before a late puncture saw him drop to 17th and last of the finishers. IMM's decision to hold out the longest before swapping from hards to softs wasn't the right one strategically but did earn him the fastest lap.</p>

<p><strong>Round 8 &ndash; Netherlands</strong><br />The grid came together as one pre-race to help each other get past the trauma of seeing Ry's vile not-chilli-not-bolognese 'dinner', however that sense of cameraderie didn't stay with everyone as the race went on. At the front Hags took a fairly dominant victory after Tony (5th) once again had his race compromised by an ill-timed safety car. CJ returned to the podium in second with Nick continuing his recent good form on the final step of the podium after Blarg's first late race tragedy of the season saw him spin out from 2nd. Chuggzi had his best finish of a strong season in 4th while Rob equalled his best of the campaign in 6th having been stone last after one of his trademark lap 1 incidents. There was controversy on the line in the battle for 7th between Ry and IMM as both crossed the line first on their screens with Codemasters awarding the position to villain of the evening and culinary war criminal; Frankie and Owl were the final two points scorers, in the latter's case for the first time this season. Just behind them was Maxey who still hasn't got off the mark for the season but did at least get his first finish in 5 attempts. The same couldn't be said for lap 5 retiree Mav, late arriver/early finisher Beckford and Jehrome (once again let down by technology in the form of both his screen and wheel) who ended up as the only drivers not classified; while beef was shared between Wiggins and DP and Sunny's 6 stop strategy didn't work out.</p>

WHY?" - FG, exactly 6 seconds before Mav crashed out<br />"You had about 3 car widths to the left of you, you ****ing mug" - Maxey; "Alright I'm not going to argue with you" - Ry; "Well because you're wrong you *****" - Maxey, after an incident in which he will admit to being wrong about post-race<br />"Oh I'm round, ****ing hell" - DP's attempts to catch the SC queue go badly<br />"I just think you'll overtake me on some corner surely" - 4th placed Jeh to Tony pre-SC restart; "Have some belief Jeh, believe in yourself man" - Mav; "you know what Mav you're right. I am going to win this race" - Jeh shows the power of a few motivational words from Mav. Tony is then past Jeh in the first sector after the restart and Jeh will have lost his wing by the end of the lap.<br />"Oh my God just to top it off the controller's disconnected" - Jehrome's millionth tech failure sees him DNF</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Round 9 &ndash; USA</strong><br />In a reversal of his usual late race fortunes Blarg grabbed a win on the line after previous leader CJ picked up a penultimate corner time penalty as pole-sitter Haguey limped home in 6th having been leading on the last lap before picking up a puncture. The podium was completed by Tony in 3rd ahead of Jehrome and the perpetually top 5 Hom. Maxey belatedly picked up his first points of the season in 7th at a track he holds a bizarre affection for, leading home Sunny, Mav and IMM who rounded out the points. Ry once again showed his one lap pace qualifying in 5th before two pieces unfortunate contact with Rob relegated him down the field and caused a minor meltdown while Chuggzi, Nick, Hamilton and Port didn't make the finish.</p>

<p><strong>Round 10 &ndash; Austria</strong><br />Austria brought one of the most remarkable qualifying sessions&nbsp;in league history&nbsp;with Hom, Hags, Ry and Tony separated by only 16 hundredths of a second at the front of the grid. However it was Blarg who took advantage of&nbsp;championship leader CJ's absence,&nbsp;recovering from 18th on the grid and an opening lap of shame to claim a victory on time penalties as Tony ended up in 5th despite crossing the line first. Jehrome's new wheel debuted in second place while Ry backed up his scintillating one lap pace to finish where he started and collect a maiden podium. For the first time this season Hom finished lower than he started in 5th, though in his defence it's hard not to when you start on pole. Coming home behind him were Chuggzi, IMM, Haguey, Port and Maxey who recovered from being the victim of a couple of crashes to notch his second consecutive points finish. It could all have been so different though with Sunny making the most of the intermediate conditions at the start to lead from 5th before being DQed for overtaking the first of 3 safety cars in the race.</p>

<p><strong>Round 11 &ndash; Singapore</strong><br />The first part of the season ended as it started with a dominant win and fastest lap from Tony after he took pole by a staggering 1.3 seconds, the biggest gap since at least F1 2017 and with his 3 runs setting the 3 quickest laps of the session. In an unusually low-key Singapore race he was followed home by CJ and Nick who both jumped Maxey after an unfortunate late race time penalty to end 4th. Hamilton and Blarg were 5th and 6th ahead of Jehrome who drove the final part of the race with noticeable wing damage after an error behind the safety car. Driver of the Day DP finished 7 places higher than he started in 8th ahead of Rob and Hom who benefitted from IMM running out of fuel on the final lap. As ever plenty of people made contact with walls as Port, Ry and Hags failed to finish and Sunny was disqualified late on.</p>

<p>As we approach 2022 and the second half of the season all eyes are on the title race, whatever happens from here CJ has done us proud but with only one non-podium finish (and one missed race) to date he does have a genuine shot at glory. There are other battles too such as the fight for 10th in the championship and 2nd in the supergrid, and of course many questions to be answered such as; will we have a 7th different winner? Will Nick ever stick to his vow of enjoying a race? Will Mav finally figure out how to get a refund for his time? And what will be the next utter nonsense to come out of Ry's mouth and/or kitchen? Only time will tell.</p>
