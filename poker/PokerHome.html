                    <h3>WSOP 1 - No Limit Hold'Em</h3>
                    <h4 class="news">
                        <p>Event number 1 of the World Serious of Poker would see 8 entrants take part in a $3.30 no-limit hold’em tournament.</p>

                        <p>
                            Jehrome (Ad3d) would have the honour of being the first man eliminated as his min-raise from early position would be called by Maxey and 3-bet by Cridersis (JdJc) with both players calling to see a flop. The flop of the 4 of spades, 7 of hearts and 4 of diamonds would see Jeh min-bet, Maxey fold and another min-raise from Cridersis with Jeh making the call. The queen of clubs on the turn would see Jehrome in for the rest of his chips with Cridersis making the call, the 5 of Hearts not one of the 3 remaining aces that Jeh needed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A re-buy from everyone’s Stoke-born, Coventry-located streamer would see him back in the game but he would be eliminated for good 12 hands later. Maxey’s big blind would be called by Cridersis (Ad7d) from under the gun and min-raised by Jeh (Ac5c) with everyone folding round to the Dutchman who called. A flop of the Jack of hearts, Ace of hearts and the King of spades saw Cridersis bet 4 big blinds into a pot of 6.5BB, Jeh’s min-raise was called with the Queen of diamonds coming out on the turn. An all-in from Jeh was called with the 7 of spades seeing Crider-Broad get rid of Jeh-Warner for the second time in the game.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Stig would be the 3rd elimination of the game a few hands later. The hand saw the action fold around to DP on the button (7h7c) who min-raised with Stig (AhJs) shoving all-in for another 7.2BB more with the MK-based player calling. A monotone board of the 9, 4 and 2 of spades gave the Crewe fan more outs but the Queen of clubs and 8 of diamonds on the turn and river would see our SRL commentator heading back to the paddock to prepare for tomorrow’s Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Port would be eliminated next as Cridersis would call from under the gun before a DP min-raise (TdAh) would see the Bradford-supporter (9sAc) raise all-in for 4.2BB. A flop of Ten of hearts, Jack of diamonds and King of spades gave DP a pair and Port a gutshot. A 5 and 8, both of diamonds, wouldn’t help Port to remain in the game. The remaining 5 players would have a 5 minute break to regain their thoughts ahead of the action resuming.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Maxey (Kc4c) would finish in 5th place as the action would be folded round to FG on the button with Maxey making an all-in under-raise from the small blind, Cridersis (As9c) from the big blind would call as would FG. A flop of 8 of diamonds, 5 of diamonds and Queen of spades would be checked by both players as would the 3 of hearts on the turn and the Queen of hearts on the river, Cridersis’ ace high beating the king-high of Maxey.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hags would be the bubble boy of the opening round of the WSOP. Both FG and Cridersis would fold with Hags (3c4d) automatically called by DP (3d2d) as our Sheffield-user had less than the big blind. A flop of the 8 of diamonds, Queen of clubs and the Ace of diamonds would give the owner of the private game some more outs to win, which he would hit on the 7 of diamonds river, despite the Yorkshireman pairing his 4 on the turn.
                            3 players remained and all would see their buy-in returned with some interest.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            FG (KdKs) would get the bronze medal in this one as he would be knocked-out by Cridersis (Qd9d). A flop of the Ten of spades, 8 of spades and the Ten of diamonds saw a gutshot for Cridersis which he would get on the turn, the Jack of spades also giving FG a flush draw, but the 7 of hearts river saw our Fulham (and many other teams)
                            supporter finished for the night.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Heads-up would see the chips go back and forth with DP taking the win. The final hand saw Cridersis min-raise from the button with DP calling before the flop came 5 of spades, 6 of clubs and the King of spades. Cridersis’ half-pot bet was called with the 4 of spades coming out on the turn where both players would check. A half-pot bet from DP would be raised all-in by Cridersis – the former’s two pair ensuring he took home the opening bracelet of the series.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Tomorrow’s event, taking place at the earlier start-time of 4.30 to avoid going against the SRL, sees 4 hole cards instead of 2 in a $2.20 buy-in game of Pot Limit Omaha.
                        </p>

                    <h3>WSOP 3 - No Limit Hold'Em</h3>
                    <h4 class="news">
                        <p>Tuesday’s event would see the $5.50 buy-in tournament that contained 7 players, the top 3 sharing the $35 prize pool.</p>

                        <p>
                            Bully, making his debut in the WSOP, would be the first man eliminated as he would call from the cut-off (Kd6c) with Stig (KsKh) raising to 4BB with the Scotsman calling. A flop of the 8 of hearts, 3 of clubs and the Jack of spades would see Bully bet 1BB with Stig putting the man from north of the border all-in. The 5 of hearts would eliminate our Clyde fan with the 5 of spades completing the board.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            DP would follow him to the bar in the following hand, the action folded round to the MK-based man on the button (TsTd) where he would make it 4BB with Maxey (QcQs) making the call. A monotone diamond flop of the Queen, 3 and 7 would see Maxey make it 600 as DP would call with a flush draw. The Ten of hearts came on the turn (giving both players a set) as Maxey bet 1000 with DP min-raising then calling the 3-bet – DP needing either the Ten of clubs or a diamond to stay in the tournament would be greeted by the dealer giving him the 8 of spades instead.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Cridersis would be next man out as both him (8c7s) and Jehrome from the small blind would call Stig’s (Jc7c) big blind, the Crewe man checking. The flop coming the 7 of diamonds, 8 of spades and Jack of hearts would see the action checked round to the Dutchman who min-bet with Stig making the call and Jeh folding. The Queen of diamonds would see Stig check-call the Cridersis all-in bet with the King of spades seeing Stig claiming his first victim of the series.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hags would be the bubble boy of this tournament as he would call from the button (AsTd) would be raised by Jeh (KhQd) with Hags going all-in and Jeh calling. The flop of the 6 of clubs, 3 of spades and 6 of spades would help neither player but the King of diamond turn would give Jeh the lead with the 7 of diamonds on the turn a brick.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Stig would finish in third place, Jeh (AdTd) would min-raise from the button with Stig shoving from the big blind for 8BB (AcJd) with Jeh making the call. The Ten of clubs, 4 of hearts and King of diamonds would see a pair for Jeh and a gutshot for Stig with a couple of Aces (hearts on the turn and spades on the river) seeing a full house for the Coventry-based player.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That would see Jeh and Maxey as the final 2. The final hand would see Jeh (Kc9s) from the button against Maxey who would check (Kh7d) with the flop coming the King of spades, 9 of clubs and the 3 of diamonds – Maxey betting 2BB with Jeh min-raising and Maxey making the call. The Ace of diamonds on the turn would see Maxey drawing to a chopped pot but shoving all-in with Jeh calling with his 2 pair, the Jack of spades not helping Maxey at all. In conclusion, first man out Jeh would also win the tournament.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What would happen in the next event, the $3.30 KO tournament?

                    <h3>WSOP 4 - Knockout Hold'Em</h3>
                    <h4 class="news">
                        <p>
                            Thursday’s event would see the first ever Knockout event with a $3.30 entry - $1.50 of the entrance fee went to the prize pool as normal while another $1.50 would go on each player’s head (you get half of that when you knock a player out while the other half goes on your head – increasing the prize for whoever knocks you out).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            6 players would enter this tournament with Jehrome the first eliminated (would be easier just C&Ping this across for every write-up). At the 125/250 blind & 30 ante level, he would shove his remaining 4.7BB from early position (7d6d) and would be called by Port (KsQh). A flop of the 2 of clubs, King of clubs and Ace of diamonds would see Jeh have a winning percentage of 5.9% and requiring running cards however the Jack of spades on the turn would kill him off before the irrelevant 4 of diamonds would come on the river.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Stig would be the next to leave in the following blind level of 150/300 with 40 ante. He would shove his final 5.7BB with Ad6s from under the gun into DP’s big blind offering of JdJh. The flop of the Jack of spades, Ten of clubs and the King of spades would give DP a set of Jacks with Stig having a gutshot to a straight with neither the 3 of diamonds turn nor the Ten of hearts river helping out the SRL commentator, giving DP a full house.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Cridersis would follow to the rail 2 hands later. Sitting in the big blind, the action would fold to DP (Ad6s) on the button who raised to 2.6BB before Cridersis (As3s) would min-raise with DP making the call. A flop of the 5 of diamonds, Ten of spades and 6 of clubs would see the Dutchman check with DP putting him all in. The 4 of diamonds on the turn would give Cridersis an up and down straight draw, requiring a 2 or 7 to keep him alive, however the Ten of hearts would see DP claim a second bounty.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hags would finish third in the competition as he would go blind-on-blind with Port in a Battle of Yorkshire. Hags would raise from the small blind (Ts3s) with his Bradford rival calling (AcKh), the flop coming with the 4 of clubs, King of clubs and the Jack of diamonds. The Queen of hearts on the turn gave Hags some more outs with the up and down straight draw but would be eliminated with the 6 of diamonds on the river.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Heads-up would see DP and Port compete with the two of them both claiming 2 victims each to this point, the former starting the heads-up battle with a little over a 2-to-1 chip advantage. A double-up from Port getting 2 pair against a missed straight would see him take the chip lead with the chips (and lead) going back and forth. The final hand would see DP (6d9h) shove his final 6BB in from the button with Port making the call (As7h), the flop of the 7 of clubs, King of diamonds and 9 of clubs giving both players a pair. The 7 of spades gave Port a three of a kind with the Ten of diamonds not the card to give DP a bigger full house (DP would have had 3 9s and 2 7s against Port’s 3 7s and 2 9s)
