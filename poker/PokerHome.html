                    <h3>WSOP 1 - No Limit Hold'Em</h3>
                    <h4 class="news">
                        <p>Event number 1 of the World Serious of Poker would see 8 entrants take part in a $3.30 no-limit hold’em tournament.</p>

                        <p>
                            Jehrome (Ad3d) would have the honour of being the first man eliminated as his min-raise from early position would be called by Maxey and 3-bet by Cridersis (JdJc) with both players calling to see a flop. The flop of the 4 of spades, 7 of hearts and 4 of diamonds would see Jeh min-bet, Maxey fold and another min-raise from Cridersis with Jeh making the call. The queen of clubs on the turn would see Jehrome in for the rest of his chips with Cridersis making the call, the 5 of Hearts not one of the 3 remaining aces that Jeh needed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A re-buy from everyone’s Stoke-born, Coventry-located streamer would see him back in the game but he would be eliminated for good 12 hands later. Maxey’s big blind would be called by Cridersis (Ad7d) from under the gun and min-raised by Jeh (Ac5c) with everyone folding round to the Dutchman who called. A flop of the Jack of hearts, Ace of hearts and the King of spades saw Cridersis bet 4 big blinds into a pot of 6.5BB, Jeh’s min-raise was called with the Queen of diamonds coming out on the turn. An all-in from Jeh was called with the 7 of spades seeing Crider-Broad get rid of Jeh-Warner for the second time in the game.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Stig would be the 3rd elimination of the game a few hands later. The hand saw the action fold around to DP on the button (7h7c) who min-raised with Stig (AhJs) shoving all-in for another 7.2BB more with the MK-based player calling. A monotone board of the 9, 4 and 2 of spades gave the Crewe fan more outs but the Queen of clubs and 8 of diamonds on the turn and river would see our SRL commentator heading back to the paddock to prepare for tomorrow’s Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne.
                            Port would be eliminated next as Cridersis would call from under the gun before a DP min-raise (TdAh) would see the Bradford-supporter (9sAc) raise all-in for 4.2BB. A flop of Ten of hearts, Jack of diamonds and King of spades gave DP a pair and Port a gutshot. A 5 and 8, both of diamonds, wouldn’t help Port to remain in the game. The remaining 5 players would have a 5 minute break to regain their thoughts ahead of the action resuming.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Maxey (Kc4c) would finish in 5th place as the action would be folded round to FG on the button with Maxey making an all-in under-raise from the small blind, Cridersis (As9c) from the big blind would call as would FG. A flop of 8 of diamonds, 5 of diamonds and Queen of spades would be checked by both players as would the 3 of hearts on the turn and the Queen of hearts on the river, Cridersis’ ace high beating the king-high of Maxey.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hags would be the bubble boy of the opening round of the WSOP. Both FG and Cridersis would fold with Hags (3c4d) automatically called by DP (3d2d) as our Sheffield-user had less than the big blind. A flop of the 8 of diamonds, Queen of clubs and the Ace of diamonds would give the owner of the private game some more outs to win, which he would hit on the 7 of diamonds river, despite the Yorkshireman pairing his 4 on the turn.
                            3 players remained and all would see their buy-in returned with some interest. FG (KdKs) would get the bronze medal in this one as he would be knocked-out by Cridersis (Qd9d). A flop of the Ten of spades, 8 of spades and the Ten of diamonds saw a gutshot for Cridersis which he would get on the turn, the Jack of spades also giving FG a flush draw, but the 7 of hearts river saw our Fulham (and many other teams)
                            supporter finished for the night.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Heads-up would see the chips go back and forth with DP taking the win. The final hand saw Cridersis min-raise from the button with DP calling before the flop came 5 of spades, 6 of clubs and the King of spades. Cridersis’ half-pot bet was called with the 4 of spades coming out on the turn where both players would check. A half-pot bet from DP would be raised all-in by Cridersis – the former’s two pair ensuring he took home the opening bracelet of the series.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Tomorrow’s event, taking place at the earlier start-time of 4.30 to avoid going against the SRL, sees 4 hole cards instead of 2 in a $2.20 buy-in game of Pot Limit Omaha.
