<h3 style="text-align: center;">SRL Rules</h3>

<p><br><br>Confirmation - In the event of grids potentially exceeding 20 the deadline for confirmation of your participation is 23.59 on the Saturday or Tuesday before race day. regardless, partipcation can be confirmed either on the thread on the SI forums or within the discord with regular SRL racers given priority, confirmation is strongly encouraged for fairness for all potential racers</p>
<p>Raceday Schedule - On a raceday within the calendar, a lobby will be created for anybody to join around 9pm where 3 lap practice races with qualifying will begin. at no earlier than 9.45pm and pending waiting on any confirmed latecomers, a full event will be set up. Drivers are expected to be in the correctly assigned car prior to the event launching.<br>Being lapped - as of f1 2025 lapped cars will no longer ghost, therefore It is essential that you let people who are lapping you overtake you cleanly without holding them up. Do not try and un-lap yourself over the next few turns unless you are considerably faster than them. The only time it would be valid to prevent yourself from being lapped is if you are currently racing for position with another driver.<br>Car damage - On this version, you DO NOT respawn if your car is totalled, because of this it is essential that you are careful whilst going into corners (especially T1) with other drivers so you do not wreck their race, controversial matters will be reviewed and penalties handed out as per the new penalty system (see later).<br>Coming back onto the track - If you have spun off or ran very wide, make sure you do not drive straight back onto the track if there are incoming cars - doing so and causing accidents could be penalised as per the penalty system. Resetting to track is highly discouraged and may potentially result in a penalty if deemed used to gain time.<br>Reversing back onto the track - If you happen to have spun out and go off track, please DO NOT attempt to rectify this by reversing back onto the track, even if you think your car will ghost, doing so and causing accidents could be penalised as per the penalty system. The only exception to this is of course the track in your area is completely empty, and no drivers are near by.<br>Being overtaken/battling for position - Please make sure that while you are battling for position that you are both considerate and fair - this includes only making 1 move to defend your position, and 1 move only. Weaving to defend your position will cause accidents and even if not could be penalised as per the penalty system.<br>On track qualifying - If you are on the track and have invalidated or ruined your lap or are on an out lap then please let faster drivers behind past you so as to not ruin their lap. DO NOT purposefully crash during qualifying once you have set your time, this will be penalised without question as per the penalty system.<br>Causing an accident - If you cause an accident on track then please let the guy(s) you have affected back in front of you - failure to do this will be penalised as per the penalty system.<br>Retiring your car - Should you wish to retire your car early, Please drive into the pits and retire via the start options. DO NOT deliberately crash out, This will incur an automatic 2 penalty as this may impact others race due to Yellow Flags etc . . .<br>Disconnections/Bugs/Mass Retirements -<br>Within Opening 25% of racing laps<br>- In the event of a mass disconnection or problems with the lobby where 20% or greater drivers being disconnected within the opening 5 laps, the race will be abandoned and the event restarted immediately, In the event of an immediate re-race, the - - weather will match the original race conditions but we will set the grid up manually as per the original grid.<br>After 25% of racing laps have been completed<br>- Where 20% or greater drivers are affected, the race will be stopped and deemed as a red flag scenario and restarted with a standing start with the order determined by the positions immediately prior to the first disconnection event happening<br>- If the disconnection event occurs during the period of a safety car or virtual safety car, then the order will be taken from immediately prior to the safety car coming out<br>- Any cars that have DNF&rsquo;d or been disqualified will not be allowed to restart the race<br>- Where the completed laps total at the point of red flag is between 25% completed laps and 50% race distance then a 35% distance race will be used for restart purposes<br>- Where the completed laps total at the point of red flag is between 50% and 75% race distance then a 25% distance race will be used for restart purposes<br>- If we have completed 75% or more of race distance, half points will be awarded as per race positions at that point and no re-run of the race will be required.<br>- if we have completed 90% or more of race distance, full points will be awarded as per race positions at that point and no re-run of the race will be required.<br>- If 20% of drivers that are still in the race (ie. not DNF or DSQ) are unable to rejoin the new lobby then the race will be abandoned and a will be rescheduled at the earliest opportunity<br>- If Crossplay is found to be the cause of the connection issues then a restart without crossplay will be chosen with the the PS5/4 being the priority console, anyone on an alternative console will be shunned and embarrased<br><br>POINT SCORING:<br><br>The league will follow the real life points scoring system awarding 25-18-15-12-10-8-6-4-2-1 points to the top 10 drivers.<br>as of f1 2025 no points are awarded for whoever sets the fastest lap, provided they finish in the top 10.<br>At the end of the season, if 2 drivers are tied then the driver with the most wins will be awarded the higher spot. Should the 2 drivers also be tied on this then the driver with the most poles will be awarded the higher spot and should we still have a tie here then the driver with the most fastest laps will be awarded the higher spot.<br><br><br>SETTINGS<br><br>SESSION OPTIONS:-<br><br>Maximum Players: 20<br>Practice Type: NONE<br>Qualifying: SHORT QUALIFYING<br>Sprint Distance: OFF (NO SPRINTS)<br>Race Distance: 50% (aka LONG)<br>Starting Grid: QUALIFYING<br>Quick Weather: DYNAMIC<br>Forecast Accuracy: APPROXIMATE<br>Session Start Time: OFFICIAL / REALISTIC<br><br>RACE SETTINGS:-<br><br>Car Performance: EQUAL PERFORMANCE<br>Parc Ferm&eacute; Rules: ON<br>Collisions: ON<br>Car Damage: REDUCED<br>Car Damage Rate: STANDARD<br>Safety Car: REDUCED<br>Red Flags: INCREASED<br>Corner Cutting: STRICT<br>Formation Lap: OFF<br>Race Starts: MANUAL<br>Pit Stop Experience: IMMERSIVE<br>Safety Car Experience: IMMERSIVE<br>Low Fuel Mode: HARD<br><br>ASSIST RESTRICTIONS:-<br><br>Steering Assist: OFF<br>Braking Assist: OFF<br>Anti-Lock Brakes: PERSONAL PREFERENCE<br>Traction Control: PERSONAL PREFERENCE<br>Automatic Gearbox: PERSONAL PREFERENCE<br>Pit Assist: ON<br>Dynamic Racing Line: PERSONAL PREFERENCE<br><br>IF ANYTHING DESCRIBED HERE ISN&apos;T CLEAR, PLEASE ASK FOR CLARIFICATION - IT IS THE DRIVERS RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THEY UNDERSTAND THE RULES AND IGNORANCE IS NOT A DEFENCE.<br><br>IF ANYONE KNOWS OF ANYTHING THAT MAY HAVE BEEN MISSED, OR ANYTHING THAT I&apos;VE GOT WRONG, PLEASE SAY SO - WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS IN THIS POST</p>
