            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                Hags: Goodness. Pick the bones out of this.<br /><br />

                Tbh, I think this is a combination of things. It's a horrible tight T1 after a long straight, and it's round one of a new season on a new game.<br />
                - I go a bit deep into T1 but avoid any issues there at least.<br />
                - Nick gets spun by Beckford but I don't think he's gone that hot into the corner.<br />
                - RFM is maybe a little bit hot too.<br />
                - Port also a bit late maybe and goes for the inside narrow angle which is always a bad idea but tbf there is carnage ahead of him. <br />
                - Nick is forced wide after recovering.<br />
                - Monty is span on the inside of T2 by Hom but I don't think there was anything more he could have done really.<br />
                - Wiggins is span by Port but I think Wiggins slows to avoid Monty's spin and Port is caught out.<br />
                - There are several other little nudges and taps at T1.<br />
                <br />
                My opinion is that I think no-one is particularly to blame for this shambles and I would call everything here a racing incident.<br />
                <br />
                Maxey: I think it's really hard to blame anyone for this. T1 of the first race in a new game, if anything I'm just amazed there were no DNFs. Racing Incidents.<br />
                <br />
                Monty: Racing Incident<br />
                <br />
                Ry: Racing Incident!<br />
                <br />
                Stefarno: This is a mess, but it's a tough T1 in the first race of a new game and I don't think anyone does anything massively wrong here. Racing incident.<br />
                <br />
                Verdict: We all were unanimous that while a few people may have been slightly bold, no-one does anything particularly bad and all incidents are a result of circumstance and the tight nature of T1, and the aftermath of all this. Racing incident(s)

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                Hags: Can't comment obviously.<br />
                <br />
                Maxey: I don't think there's really anything in this, unfortunate for Chuggzi as the contact really shouldn't spin him but I don't think Hags has done anything wrong. Racing Incident.<br />
                <br />
                Monty:  Feels to me like that was Codies Physics? Racing Incident<br />
                <br />
                Ry: **** way to spin but racing Incident<br />
                <br />
                Stefarno: Hags does understeer a tad here but he still leaves plenty of space, the actual spin seems like very silly Codies physics. It's marginal but I'd call this a racing incident.<br />
                <br />
                My fellow stewards all agreed this was an unfortunate racing incident.

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                Hags: I think this is fair obvious - 1 pt to Port for a punt from behind.<br />
                <br />
                Maxey: Port's far too late on the breaks here, 1 pt.<br />
                <br />
                Monty: Yeah Port was Late on the brakes here so 1 Point Port<br />
                <br />
                Ry: Port just misjudged it, 1 point.<br />
                <br />
                Stefarno: Port has outbroke himself here and spun Owl through no fault of his own. Personally based on the rules I think this is 2 points.<br />
                <br />
                Hags: I tend to agree with you on Port vs Owl, but then I felt Wiggins on Owl was just as bad but with a different outcome and we get onto dodgy ground punishing the outcome rather than the cause imo, maybe Wiggins gets extra credit trying to avoid?<br />
                <br />
                Stefarno: I feel like like we have to factor in the impact to some extent - obviously every incident is different and there can be mitigating factors, but generally little impact 1 point, minor damage or time loss 2 points, serious damage or time loss 3 points. Imo the impact on Owl has enough of an impact on him and it's a careless outbraking without any mitigation that it is 2 points rather than 1<br />
                <br />
                Hags: I tend to agree really, I though 2 rather than 1 initially anyway. I'll change my judgment on Port vs Owl to 2 pts, tho the majority decision remains 1 pt<br />
                <br />
                Despite my late change of mind, the majority decision is still 1 point to Port.

                Maxey: Yeah, Wiggins brakes too late, goes for a bit of a lunge and just hasn't slowed down enough. 1 pt.<br /><br />

                Monty: Yeah another late on the brakes 1 point Wiggins<br /><br />

                Ry: Late again! 1 point Wiggins.<br /><br />

                Hags: Cold tyres might be to blame, but really Hom should show more caution. 1 pt to Hom.<br /><br />

                Maxey: Definitely think the cold tyres/brakes play a part here, but Hom does brake too late given Nick is right in front of him. 1 pt. <br /><br />

                Monty: Another late on the brakes incident 1 point Hom <br /><br />

                Ry: Late on the breaks is quite a theme here - 1 point<br /><br />

                Stefarno: Nick is clearly struggling with cold hard tyres here and seems to brake very early for the hairpin - I still think Hom should have been more cautious here but as a result so I think this is 1 point rather than 2.<br /><br />

                Unanimous 1 point to Hom.<br /><br />

                Hags: Can't comment.<br /><br />

                Maxey: As per the rules, this is a slam-dunk point to Beckford, and also worth reminding drivers that AI control is ***** and will not get out of the way of drivers on hot laps. 1 pt.<br /><br />

                Monty: Has to be a point to beckford , and a warning about leaving the AI to drive<br /><br />

                Ry: Beckford point <br /><br />

                Stefarno: Whatever the AI does, the onus is on you to not get in the way of people on laps - 1 point.<br /><br />

                The stewards decided Beckford deserves a 1 point penalty for blocking in qualifying. A reminder to everyone that if you are on track in qualifying, you shouldn't be on pause/AI mode unless it is safe and there are no cars around.<br /><br />

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>

                Hags: Can't comment, but I think it speaks for itself...<br /><br />

                Maxey: I think DP still made it round to get a lap in, and only Hags takes damage, so I'm happy to go with a point for this. I'm assuming DP is trying to get a gap and get his tyres warm. 1 pt. <br /><br />

                Monty: Will also go for the 1 point<br /><br />

                Ry: Probably 1 point<br /><br />

                Stefarno: This seems very silly, but as DP didn't get a pen and still got his lap in I think it is 1 point.<br /><br />

                1 point to me, for being a silly boy.

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                Hags: Not a great view and I've reqested footage from DP. It sounds like DP got a bit of oversteer which is unlucky. Will revisit later.<br /><br />

                Maxey: Would like to see DP's view but without it, it's a point. 1 pt. <br /><br />

                Monty: Without DPs footage will be 1 point DP <br /><br />

                Hags: DP did also confirm that he does NOT have any footage, so even though I suspect it wasn't really his fault with the new guidelines about posting clips it's a 1 pt penalty to DP from me.<br /><br />

                Ry: DP 1 point<br /><br />

                Stefarno: Based on the highlights footage from Nick (ed. see above) Personally I think it is clear enough that DP lost it accelerating on the kerb and there is a racing incident.<br /><br />

                Hags: Great find - but I don't think it's clear enough tbh, even though it kinda shows DP getting some oversteer<br /><br />


                We suspect DP is right and that oversteer is to blame here, but sadly without any footage we can only go on what we have, which is Nick getting a whack from the side hard enough to spin him around. 1 point to DP.
