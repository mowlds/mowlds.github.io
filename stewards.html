            <i>
                Hags: RFM didn't block me as I was on an out/in-lap - but I think he clearly baulks Rob here. 1 point to RFM.<br />
                <br />
                Ry: Yeah deffo blocks rob, regardless of if rob is on a lap or not he should have moved just in case. 1 point.<br />
                <br />
                Monty: 1 point RFM  for blocking rob<br />
                <br />
                Stefarno: Standard 1 point for blocking here.<br />
                <br />
                Maxey: Easy 1pt to RFM.
                <br />

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                Hags: Even more obvious really. I think Nick said in the thread that he thought DP might have been on an out lap, but he wasn't and ruined DP's lap. 1 point to Nick but I will also request DP's footage for clarity.
                <br /><br />
                Ry: Nick 1 point, can tell he didnt realise but still not right.
                <br /><br />
                Monty: Looks like nick didn`t realise DP was on a fast lap, but still has to be a 1 point to nick
                <br /><br />
                Stefarno: Obviously wasn't aware DP was on a lap but that's no excuse, standard 1 point.
                <br /><br />
                Maxey: As above, 1pt to Nick.
                <br /><br />
                Verdict: We didn't get DP's footage, but from what we had it was still fairly clear - 1 point to Nick for blocking in qualifying.

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                Hags: We should discourage this, even in qualifying. Being annoyed isn't really an excuse, go back to the pits and stew there. A warning for Rob and to everyone that next time someone does this we will come down stronger on this.
                <br /><br />
                Ry: Warning for roberto, doesnt have anyone around him at the time so its a bit meh, but could have easily made a yellow flag that puts another driver off their lap.
                <br /><br />
                Monty: Warning for Rob for deliberate DNF
                <br /><br />
                Stefarno: I mean technically the rule is "DO NOT purposefully crash during qualifying once you have set your time, this will be penalised without question as per the penalty system." however that is going back probably about 5 years when crashing out of quali would give you new tyres for the race. Given that hasn't come up in so long, he didn't get any benefit from it and it had no impact on anyone I think a warning is fine here but let people know that we will punish deliberate quali DNFs in the future as they can impact other drivers and there is no need to do it.
                <br /><br />
                Maxey: I think we should go with a warning as well. Really crashing out of quali doesn't effect anyone else, but should be avoided as much as possible, because Codies.
                <br /><br />
                Verdict: A warning for Rob on this occasion and a general note to everyone, don't deliberately DNF in qualifying, just because it hasn't affected anyone doesn't mean it might not in future.

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                Hags: I think this is a lot more closing speed than anyone at T1 in Bahrain, and even though I think Jehrome and CJ come away unscathed I think this is 1 point to Nick here.
                <br /><br />
                Ry: Nick must hate T1. yeah 1 point to nick even tho he only impacted himself.
                <br /><br />
                Monty: 1 point nick
                <br /><br />
                Stefarno: Way too much speed here but as it is T1 and he seemingly only caused major impact on himself I'd say 1 point rather than 2.
                <br /><br />
                Maxey: I'm fine with a point here, he's gone way too deep but in the end, only really had much of an impact on himself.
                <br /><br />
                Verdict: 1 point for Nick for braking far too late into T1.

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                Hags: DP doesn't actually brake that late according to the racing line, but Beckford and Hom both brake at reasonable times and DP piles into the side of Beckford and tags Hom for good measure. I think this is a good example that always blindly following the racing line isn't always a great idea - there's clearly slipstream at play here plus high fuel and not quite warmed up tyres. Always brake for the conditions, etc. 1 point to DP.
                <br /><br />
                Ry: Dp breaks perfectly for that corner... if there is nobody in front of him, coasting a bit earlier knowing the slipstream etc was giving him that extra little bit of pace would have helped here. 1 point DP.
                <br /><br />
                Monty: 1 point DP
                <br /><br />
                Stefarno: Pretty standard 1 point here.
                <br /><br />
                Maxey: 1pt to DP.
                <br /><br />
                Verdict: 1 point to DP for braking a touch too late and swiping the side of Beckford and affecting Hom too.

            <i>
                Hags: Nick has a bizarre overheating of the rear right tyre, some serious slip going on there, maybe due to low diff settings. Either way it pitches him into a spin and the luckless Hom is helpless and unfortunate to DNF. Racing incident.
                <br /><br />

            <i>
                Hags: This is very similar to Port vs Owl from Bahrain, but this time the result is that two cars indirectly DNF. I changed my mind from 1 to 2 points last time but I'm in no doubt this time - 2 points to Port for the distance before hitting Owl, the closing speed and the after effects [REDACTED]
                <br /><br />
                Ry: Agree with hags, port 2 points. Its just a lapse of concentration [REDACTED] and 2 cars have been affected.

                Monty: Also agree with Hags here, 2 points Port
                <br /><br />
                Stefarno: [REDACTED] While it was the aftermath rather than the initial contact, it is still needless contact from behind and caused 2 cars to DNF. 2 points.
                <br /><br />
                Maxey: 2pts to Port.

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                Hags: Beckford makes a clean pass and is nearly a full car ahead albeit on the outside line, Monty goes late and deep and tags the side of Beckford. I think really Monty was way too ambitious here and even though Beckford left a gap he went in too hot and bounced of him really. Racing incident.
                <br /><br />
                Ry: Monty way too late on the breaks there - probably just got put off looking at beckford that he was late to break, but hes only affected himself. If beckford had spun its a different story i think. Racing incident.
                <br /><br />
                Monty: N/A
                <br /><br />
                Stefarno: Beckford left space but Monty went into the corner too hot. Only impact is on himself so racing incident.
                <br /><br />
                Maxey: Racing incident, tbh I don't really think Monty does too much wrong.

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                Hags: This is a tough one to call because it seems a minor tap from Wiggins on Monty to spin him around, but I think the principles of this incident are the same as Port's above really. He's broke too late, tagged Monty and ruined his race, [REDACTED]. Borderline, but 2 points to Wiggins for me. It's lazy and it needs stamping down on.
                <br /><br />
                Ry: Clumsy from wiggins, its not malicious at all but we penalised port and this is the same thing. 2 points wiggo.
                <br /><br />
                Monty: N/A
                <br /><br />
                Stefarno: I'm a bit torn on this one really, the contact was so minor but given the huge impact on Monty, the distance he was back [REDACTED] it nudges it to 2 points imo.
                <br /><br />
                Maxey: 2pts to Wiggins.
                <br /><br />
                Verdict: 2 points to Wiggins for similar reasons to Port above. Long way back [REDACTED], even if the impact is only slight on this occasion the effect on Monty is huge and ruins his race.

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                Hags: Beckford is caught out by Ry braking early-ish for T1 but that's his right, he then pulls right and plows into the back of Stefarno and then blames Ry 😄 Bizarre sequence, but I think because only Beckford suffers and no-one else loses out we can go with racing incident here.
                <br /><br />
                Hags: EDIT - I didn't notice there was more to Beckford's video! He clearly spins Stefarno around at T3. It's not a long distance late braking incident though it does cost stefarno time obviously. I think on balance this is 1 point to Beckford, rather than 2.
                <br /><br />
                Ry: Wont comment too much on this as im partly involved??? but 1 point to beckford seems fair.
                <br /><br />
                Monty: 1 point Beckford
                <br /><br />
                Stefarno: Obviously can't comment on this.
                <br /><br />
                Maxey: Really not sure what Beckford's issue with Ry is to be honest. 1pt to Beckford for spinning Stefarno.
                <br /><br />
                Verdict: The T1 stuff is bizarre but only Beckford to blame... but he gets 1 point for his spin of Stefarno at turn four.

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                Hags: Nothing to punish here, but a general note to all drivers really that they need to be more careful around safety cars. Nick loses a place to Wiggins because he immediately slows for the SC and the game doesn't give it him back. Likewise Rob loses a spot to DP at the restart due to bunching and a badly coded game. Beckford floors it because the game lets him and he gains 2/3 free places that he shouldn't have. Not sure how to solve all these really, apart from be cautious, don't scum positions because the game is broken and follow the below guide at restarts which clearly wasn't followed here.
                <br /><br />
                Hags: For my part, people seemed to complain about my restart but I don't change speed or slow down then speed up. People are anticipating that I'm going to go immediately out of the last corner, Maxey goes, Blarg goes, Tony hits the back of someone. Of course people are going to react but be sensible.
                <br /><br />
                Hags: As for the last video, a general note that SC impacts seem to be fixed to punish the driver behind but still be aware that they are still a problem, so be careful.
                <br /><br />
                Ry: Nothing punishing, just need to get people to be more careful - myself included. also probably an idea that people dont have their phones near them as it can be distracting 😄
                <br /><br />
                Monty: Nothing to punish here
                <br /><br />
                Stefarno: SC restarts are always going to have some shambles - the cars at the back can't see if the front car has gone or not and if the cars ahead floor it obviously anyone is going to respond to that. What Beckford does is very high risk but the yellow flag is gone before he overtakes (I presume he passed the SC line?) so he got away with it really. I think we'll just have to warn people to be careful behind the SC, if they scum people or cause contact they'll be penalised.
                <br /><br />
                Maxey: Nothing wrong with Hags' restart, can't really see anything particularly wrong that anyone else has done.
                <br /><br />
                Verdict: Nothing to penalise, but generally people need to be more careful about overtaking other cars at safety car starts/restarts, don't scum others at the restart if they're held and you're not and generally stick to the above positioning guide as it seemed a bit shambolic the other day.

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                Hags: Goodness. Pick the bones out of this.<br /><br />

                Tbh, I think this is a combination of things. It's a horrible tight T1 after a long straight, and it's round one of a new season on a new game.<br />
                - I go a bit deep into T1 but avoid any issues there at least.<br />
                - Nick gets spun by Beckford but I don't think he's gone that hot into the corner.<br />
                - RFM is maybe a little bit hot too.<br />
                - Port also a bit late maybe and goes for the inside narrow angle which is always a bad idea but tbf there is carnage ahead of him. <br />
                - Nick is forced wide after recovering.<br />
                - Monty is span on the inside of T2 by Hom but I don't think there was anything more he could have done really.<br />
                - Wiggins is span by Port but I think Wiggins slows to avoid Monty's spin and Port is caught out.<br />
                - There are several other little nudges and taps at T1.<br />
                <br />
                My opinion is that I think no-one is particularly to blame for this shambles and I would call everything here a racing incident.<br />
                <br />
                Maxey: I think it's really hard to blame anyone for this. T1 of the first race in a new game, if anything I'm just amazed there were no DNFs. Racing Incidents.<br />
                <br />
                Monty: Racing Incident<br />
                <br />
                Ry: Racing Incident!<br />
                <br />
                Stefarno: This is a mess, but it's a tough T1 in the first race of a new game and I don't think anyone does anything massively wrong here. Racing incident.<br />
                <br />
                Verdict: We all were unanimous that while a few people may have been slightly bold, no-one does anything particularly bad and all incidents are a result of circumstance and the tight nature of T1, and the aftermath of all this. Racing incident(s)

                Maxey: I don't think there's really anything in this, unfortunate for Chuggzi as the contact really shouldn't spin him but I don't think Hags has done anything wrong. Racing Incident.<br />

                Hags: I think this is fair obvious - 1 pt to Port for a punt from behind.<br />
                <br />
                Maxey: Port's far too late on the breaks here, 1 pt.<br />
                <br />
                Monty: Yeah Port was Late on the brakes here so 1 Point Port<br />
                <br />
                Ry: Port just misjudged it, 1 point.<br />
                <br />
                Stefarno: Port has outbroke himself here and spun Owl through no fault of his own. Personally based on the rules I think this is 2 points.<br />
                <br />
                Hags: I tend to agree with you on Port vs Owl, but then I felt Wiggins on Owl was just as bad but with a different outcome and we get onto dodgy ground punishing the outcome rather than the cause imo, maybe Wiggins gets extra credit trying to avoid?<br />
                <br />
                Stefarno: I feel like like we have to factor in the impact to some extent - obviously every incident is different and there can be mitigating factors, but generally little impact 1 point, minor damage or time loss 2 points, serious damage or time loss 3 points. Imo the impact on Owl has enough of an impact on him and it's a careless outbraking without any mitigation that it is 2 points rather than 1<br />
                <br />
                Hags: I tend to agree really, I though 2 rather than 1 initially anyway. I'll change my judgment on Port vs Owl to 2 pts, tho the majority decision remains 1 pt<br />
                <br />
                Despite my late change of mind, the majority decision is still 1 point to Port.

                Hags: Cold tyres might be to blame, but really Hom should show more caution. 1 pt to Hom.<br /><br />

                Maxey: Definitely think the cold tyres/brakes play a part here, but Hom does brake too late given Nick is right in front of him. 1 pt. <br /><br />

                Monty: Another late on the brakes incident 1 point Hom <br /><br />

                Ry: Late on the breaks is quite a theme here - 1 point<br /><br />

                Stefarno: Nick is clearly struggling with cold hard tyres here and seems to brake very early for the hairpin - I still think Hom should have been more cautious here but as a result so I think this is 1 point rather than 2.<br /><br />

                Unanimous 1 point to Hom.<br /><br />

            <i>
                Hags: Can't comment.<br /><br />

                Maxey: As per the rules, this is a slam-dunk point to Beckford, and also worth reminding drivers that AI control is ***** and will not get out of the way of drivers on hot laps. 1 pt.<br /><br />

                Monty: Has to be a point to beckford , and a warning about leaving the AI to drive<br /><br />

                Ry: Beckford point <br /><br />

                Stefarno: Whatever the AI does, the onus is on you to not get in the way of people on laps - 1 point.<br /><br />

                The stewards decided Beckford deserves a 1 point penalty for blocking in qualifying. A reminder to everyone that if you are on track in qualifying, you shouldn't be on pause/AI mode unless it is safe and there are no cars around.<br /><br />

                Hags: Can't comment, but I think it speaks for itself...<br /><br />

                Maxey: I think DP still made it round to get a lap in, and only Hags takes damage, so I'm happy to go with a point for this. I'm assuming DP is trying to get a gap and get his tyres warm. 1 pt. <br /><br />

                Monty: Will also go for the 1 point<br /><br />

                Ry: Probably 1 point<br /><br />

                Stefarno: This seems very silly, but as DP didn't get a pen and still got his lap in I think it is 1 point.<br /><br />

                1 point to me, for being a silly boy.

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                Hags: Not a great view and I've reqested footage from DP. It sounds like DP got a bit of oversteer which is unlucky. Will revisit later.<br /><br />

                Maxey: Would like to see DP's view but without it, it's a point. 1 pt. <br /><br />

                Monty: Without DPs footage will be 1 point DP <br /><br />

                Hags: DP did also confirm that he does NOT have any footage, so even though I suspect it wasn't really his fault with the new guidelines about posting clips it's a 1 pt penalty to DP from me.<br /><br />

                Ry: DP 1 point<br /><br />

                Stefarno: Based on the highlights footage from Nick (ed. see above) Personally I think it is clear enough that DP lost it accelerating on the kerb and there is a racing incident.<br /><br />

                Hags: Great find - but I don't think it's clear enough tbh, even though it kinda shows DP getting some oversteer<br /><br />


                We suspect DP is right and that oversteer is to blame here, but sadly without any footage we can only go on what we have, which is Nick getting a whack from the side hard enough to spin him around. 1 point to DP.
