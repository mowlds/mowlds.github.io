                Unanimous again as the stewards sympathise with Rob, but feel that this can only be put down to a racing incident, taking into account it is turn one and the conditions

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>

                Again a fully united front from the stewards as they all agree that Myles deserves a point here for interfering with another driver on a hot lap

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                As above, so below. The stewards acknowledge that this one is not as bad as Myles', but still award One Point to Beckford.
            </i>

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                With the stewards split 2-2 here (which I didn't realise until I was typing this all up), we needed a guest steward. Luckily a former steward was around and came to my aid:

                "Seems like he's just outbraked himself in tricky conditions. He only hurt himself and nobody else got damage or lost positions, as far as I could tell. However, we're supposed to review things regardless of the consequences (or lack of), so I'm tempted to say 1 point to Hags just for hitting another driver."

                So with that, it's a point to Hags.

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                Unfortunately, we remain without a good view of this incident and are therefore reluctantly forced to conclude that No Further Action will be taken at this time. We reserve the right to change this with new evidence.

                However, should any more similar shambles occur during the race or qualifying, the stewards will take an exceedingly dim view of this, so Chuggzi and Myles may consider themselves on their final warnings.

                While the stewards symphatise with Nick for getting done over by Tony ****ing his delta and then escaping nearly three seconds up the road, we feel that this was not an intentional ploy to gain an advantage. Should we see this abused intentionally, then the stewards may be forced to take action, but in this case, we take No Further Action (Side Note: There was some feeling among the stewards that the advantage could be given back, but without live, in-race, stewarding this would be very difficult to police and would rely on drivers self policing)

                - Sunny drives into Ry aggressively to block him and gives them both a 5s penalty. 2 points to Sunny for the penalty, 3 further points for deliberately driving into another car (reduced from 6 as it was low speed behind the safety car and Ry already had damage)

DP also smashed the back of Nick which would usually be the car behind's fault but the stewards feel Nick broke very late and aggressively to try and avoid Hom and DP was caught out.

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                1) The incident in turn 1 can only be described as a racing incident. Maxey can't do much about the contact with DP, both because of other cars and because of some slight oversteer that causes the collision.
                2) The incident in turn 4 is far too ambitious from DP, but since he only kills himself, we've ruled this a racing incident as well.
                3) The stewards have decided on no further action for the 'Severe Collision Penalty'. While Maxey is at fault here, the SC warning and track change do not happen until well after the contact and we're happy to blame this one on the poor coding from our Masters of Code.

With that in mind, Sunny is awarded only one point instead of the usual two.

                Bit messy here, some sendy moves, wheel banging and otherwise driving below a standard we would expect in a Serious Racing League...

                Some significant disagreement here between the remaining stewards that were not involved in the incident, but after careful consideration the stewards have decided the following:

                Maxey is blameless in all this, his initial overtake is fine, but then becomes a passenger as the two other cars barge their way past on the inside. No Further Action

                Jehrome's move under breaking forces CJ off the track, effectively causing the time penalty and is then late on the brakes, causing Maxey's wobble. The stewards have decided he will receive One Penalty Point for this.

                CJ is effectively forced off the track by Jeh's move under breaking. The stewards note that he is breaking the whole time, but being on the grass/kerbs makes it harder for the car to slow, which is why he fails to make the corner properly. Therefore no further action will be taken

                Possibly the defining moment of the race, as CJ, Chuggzi and Blarg go three wide down the straight coming into the bus stop. CJ is perhaps a bit rude sending it up the inside on Chuggzi, which forces Chuggzi wide and causes him to oversteer into the Blarg. But the stewards are of the opinion that while CJ's move is a bit sendy, he is entitled to go for it and cannot be blamed for Chuggzi's oversteer into Blarg. So at the end of the day, we have ruled this a racing incident.

While both drivers get a penalty, the stewards are satisfied that this does not require the standard two point penalty and instead give Rob a warning to be aware of cars in front under the SC.

                "Points to be won", but alas the only points DP wins with this lunge is penalty points. Not for the initial send down the inside, which was bad, but harmless, but for rejoining the track and cutting across Wiggins in doing so. We therefore award One Penalty point to DP.

                Well.
                <br />
                Without going into huge detail, we spent ages deliberating this one. Essentially there are two main culprits. RFM by his own admission lost control of the wheel/pad and barrelled into T1 out of control, takes many wings and DNF's Nick. For that we had punished it the same as Port's incident here a few seasons ago and awarded three points to RFM. Jehrome has a separate incident which also has knock on effects as he hits the back of Ry - for that we have awarded Jehrome with a two point penalty.
                <br />
                There are a litany of other little touches, scrapes and penalties awarded for SC contact but given the context of this shambles we've decided no further action on everything else.

                We were split 2-2 on whether this was a racing incident or a possible point for CJ - so we had to call in the famous guest steward who had this to say.
                <br />
                "Whilst this is a rude send from CJ, I do think he makes the corner if Ry isn't there. It's unfortunate for Ry as he loses out to Chuggzi too, but as race engineer Bulbasaur says on the clip the cars behind are on fresher/faster tyres so they would have had him on the straight anyway.
                So I'll rule a racing incident and blame the stewards when the ruling is revealed."

                Nothing wrong with the restart by myself - as for the later shambles, Jehrome does nothing wrong at T2/3 really, takes a wider line and DP should have known he was driving into a wedge really.
                Sunny turning into DP at the T4 apex is adjudged to be Sunny's fault and he is given a 1 point penalty. The shambles with Hom passing cars off track before giving them back and various other touches are adjudged racing incidents.
                Monty's spin is adjudged no further action as Stefarno doesn't cut across and Monty should have backed out as it isn't a passing place.

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                At the end of the rear DRS straight, Rob is very late on the brakes and pushes Wiggins wide in his attempt to make the apex. Even if there is no damage to Wiggins car, the stewards have adjudged this to be sufficiently bad driving to award a penalty point to Rob.

Beckford will receive One Penalty Point for leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage, the stewards taking into consideration that he’s being pushed off to some extent by the shambles in front. Ry is lucky not to receive any points on this occasion.
