            <i>
                Similar to Beckford and the Montster in Imola, it's kinda both their faults. FG is taking the racing line but maybe should be aware there's a car heading towards his left, but at the same time it's a strange decision for Monty to go into the wedge than go right where all the space is and also is the inside line for the next corner. Racing incident.

                Well.
                <br />
                Without going into huge detail, we spent ages deliberating this one. Essentially there are two main culprits. RFM by his own admission lost control of the wheel/pad and barrelled into T1 out of control, takes many wings and DNF's Nick. For that we had punished it the same as Port's incident here a few seasons ago and awarded three points to RFM. Jehrome has a separate incident which also has knock on effects as he hits the back of Ry - for that we have awarded Jehrome with a two point penalty.
                <br />
                There are a litany of other little touches, scrapes and penalties awarded for SC contact but given the context of this shambles we've decided no further action on everything else.

                "Whilst this is a rude send from CJ, I do think he makes the corner if Ry isn't there. It's unfortunate for Ry as he loses out to Chuggzi too, but as race engineer Bulbasaur says on the clip the cars behind are on fresher/faster tyres so they would have had him on the straight anyway.
                So I'll rule a racing incident and blame the stewards when the ruling is revealed."

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                Nothing wrong with the restart by myself - as for the later shambles, Jehrome does nothing wrong at T2/3 really, takes a wider line and DP should have known he was driving into a wedge really.
                Sunny turning into DP at the T4 apex is adjudged to be Sunny's fault and he is given a 1 point penalty. The shambles with Hom passing cars off track before giving them back and various other touches are adjudged racing incidents.
                Monty's spin is adjudged no further action as Stefarno doesn't cut across and Monty should have backed out as it isn't a passing place.

                This is rather unfortunate as the cars coming out of the pit (Nick and Beckford) get screwed over by being under the delta, due to not having control in the pits. As a result, Beckford has to drop the anchors and unfortunately this catches out Owl. This is declared a Racing Incident

Both drivers aren't fully without blame, Wiggins releasing the brakes in the braking zone, causing him to shoot forward, but also driving into a wedge, while Blarg takes the apex from a wide line, essentially cutting off any cars on the inside. As neither driver is fully to blame, the stewards have declared this a racing incident.

                At the end of the rear DRS straight, Rob is very late on the brakes and pushes Wiggins wide in his attempt to make the apex. Even if there is no damage to Wiggins car, the stewards have adjudged this to be sufficiently bad driving to award a penalty point to Rob.

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>The stewards were split on this decision, but the majority verdict is that while Tony did go too deep, Frankie had already outbraked himself and was going wide already. By luck more than judgment, this is a racing incident.</i>

            <h3>Hags vs DP - Lap 1</h3>

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>The stewards have decided unanimously that this is a classic case of #CodiesPhysics that DP is unfortunately screwed over by on this occasion. Racing incident.</i>

            <h3>Hags vs Nick - Lap 16</h3>

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                Similar to the above, the stewards decided that I had left enough room and Nick was done over by the game physics, then again when he tried to accelerate. Racing incident.

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>CJ and Jeh come together in turn 2, causing damage to Jeh’s front wing. A difference of opinions here, but the majority verdict is a Racing Incident, with some leeway being given due to this being Lap 1 and Hags spinning in front.</i>

            <h3>Port vs Maxey vs Beckford - Lap 5</h3>

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>Port, Maxey and Beckford go three wide into the stadium, a move that’s always going to end in tears for someone. In this case, Beckford comes off the worst and spins, while Maxey gets a big wobble. In another split decision however, the panel have adjudged this a Racing Incident</i>

            <h3>Sunny vs Hags - Lap 23</h3>
            <iframe width="500" height="306" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e8odeS7Guaw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>Another one coming into the stadium, but this time it’s a race ender for Hags as Sunny gives him a tap from behind and codies physics does the rest. While the panel were split here again, the final decision is One Point to Sunny, as he does drive into the car in front of him and it results in a DNF.</i>

            <h3>Port vs Maxey - Lap 8</h3>

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>The first time the panel were actually in agreement as Maxey and Port come together heading down to the stadium and Maxey shoots off down the escape route. The panel has found neither driver to blame for this and adjudges this a Racing Incident</i>

            <h3>Nick retiring on purpose, bringing out the SC - Lap 14</h3>
            <iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=FitClumsyEyeballPeanutButterJellyTime-pfJpLEa0JG_i6AUH&parent=www.seriousracingleague.com" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="306" width="500"></iframe>
            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                Nick already admitted fault here, but this is obviously a bad error of judgement. While the stewards have decided to apply a degree of leniency here and due to the stewards previously not applying the full extent of the penalty laws, this is Three Points to Nick.
                A reminder for all drivers: 6 Points – Extreme bad driving bringing the SRL into disrepute, such as any deliberate action to crash into another driver, or deliberately crashing out of the race.

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                Ry leaves the track and gains a lasting advantage and is blatant in doing so. In reality, he should have given up the position and tried again and as such, the stewards have decided to award Two Points to Rye in another split decision
            </i>

            <h3>Ry vs DP vs Beckford - Lap 22</h3>

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                This is sheer carnage and caused the stewards a lot of headache. The contact between DP and Rye in turn 2-3 is adjudged to have been caused by wheelspin on old tyres, however, DP will receive One Penalty Point for cutting across Beckford on the run down to T4 and One Penalty Point for unsafely rejoining the track after overshooting the corner. Beckford will receive One Penalty Point for leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage, the stewards taking into consideration that he’s being pushed off to some extent by the shambles in front. Ry is lucky not to receive any points on this occasion.
            </i>

            <h3>Sunny vs Beckford - Lap 29</h3>

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                At least one the stewards can agree on and although Sunny moves across late, he is trying to avoid the car in front and the stewards agree that this is a Racing Incident
