            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                The races defining and most controversial incident, with Beckford and Monty nearly coming to blows on Nick's chat - but the majority view is that without footage from Beckford it's impossible to apportion full
                or even partial blame either way, so we have had to call this a racing incident. The suspicion is that Monty might have left a smidge too little room on his left but also that perhaps the touch from Beckford wobbled him left -
                but alas, we can only judge what we see.

            <h3>Blarg vs Owl - Lap 9</h3>

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                The majority view is that despite Owl going deep, Blarg knew he was there and should have left more room at the apex knowing Owl was on a very acute angle, and he had a right to the corner as he didn't go off the track. 1 point to Blarg.
                <br />
                Just after this same incident we have all agreed that Owl rejoined the track in an unsafe manner and is also awarded a 1 point penalty.

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>The stewards were split on this decision, but the majority verdict is that while Tony did go too deep, Frankie had already outbraked himself and was going wide already. By luck more than judgment, this is a racing incident.</i>

            <h3>Hags vs DP - Lap 1</h3>

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>The stewards have decided unanimously that this is a classic case of #CodiesPhysics that DP is unfortunately screwed over by on this occasion. Racing incident.</i>

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                Similar to the above, the stewards decided that I had left enough room and Nick was done over by the game physics, then again when he tried to accelerate. Racing incident.

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>CJ and Jeh come together in turn 2, causing damage to Jeh’s front wing. A difference of opinions here, but the majority verdict is a Racing Incident, with some leeway being given due to this being Lap 1 and Hags spinning in front.</i>

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>Port, Maxey and Beckford go three wide into the stadium, a move that’s always going to end in tears for someone. In this case, Beckford comes off the worst and spins, while Maxey gets a big wobble. In another split decision however, the panel have adjudged this a Racing Incident</i>

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>Another one coming into the stadium, but this time it’s a race ender for Hags as Sunny gives him a tap from behind and codies physics does the rest. While the panel were split here again, the final decision is One Point to Sunny, as he does drive into the car in front of him and it results in a DNF.</i>

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>The first time the panel were actually in agreement as Maxey and Port come together heading down to the stadium and Maxey shoots off down the escape route. The panel has found neither driver to blame for this and adjudges this a Racing Incident</i>

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                Nick already admitted fault here, but this is obviously a bad error of judgement. While the stewards have decided to apply a degree of leniency here and due to the stewards previously not applying the full extent of the penalty laws, this is Three Points to Nick.
                A reminder for all drivers: 6 Points – Extreme bad driving bringing the SRL into disrepute, such as any deliberate action to crash into another driver, or deliberately crashing out of the race.

                Ry leaves the track and gains a lasting advantage and is blatant in doing so. In reality, he should have given up the position and tried again and as such, the stewards have decided to award Two Points to Rye in another split decision

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                This is sheer carnage and caused the stewards a lot of headache. The contact between DP and Rye in turn 2-3 is adjudged to have been caused by wheelspin on old tyres, however, DP will receive One Penalty Point for cutting across Beckford on the run down to T4 and One Penalty Point for unsafely rejoining the track after overshooting the corner. Beckford will receive One Penalty Point for leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage, the stewards taking into consideration that he’s being pushed off to some extent by the shambles in front. Ry is lucky not to receive any points on this occasion.

            <h4>Stewards Verdict:</h4>
            <i>
                At least one the stewards can agree on and although Sunny moves across late, he is trying to avoid the car in front and the stewards agree that this is a Racing Incident
